This project is a REST API, an architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This REST API, used for the
movie app "myFlix", will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from
your database and store that data in a non-relational way.
 
## Technologies Used:
* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

## Documentation:
Each endpoint and their intended responses can be found on the documentation page.
