      This project is a REST API, an architected database built using
      JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This REST API, used for the
      movie app "myFlix", will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like
      GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from
      your database and store that data in a non-relational way.
